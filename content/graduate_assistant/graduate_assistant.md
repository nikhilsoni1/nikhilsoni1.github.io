# Summary

I assist the ePubs, Purdue University Press in maintaining their open access repository. By undertaking
the following activities

1. Automation of processing academic texts to extract necessary metadata.
1. Vet the metadata data using web scraping techniques to ascertain whether a particular 
academic text complies the requirement of a text being permissible in the open access domain.
1. Batch upload (~2000 academic publishings) to the Electronic Theses and Dissertations repositories.
1. Collaborate with other open access publishers to post Purdue authors' content from their
repository to our repository at purdue.

This position requires a significant amount of web scraping and text analysis to efficiently
work with scores of document at once. Time is of the essence because processing over 2000 academic publishings
in a span of 6 months with minimal errors is a crucial task.
