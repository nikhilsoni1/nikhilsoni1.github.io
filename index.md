#   About Me
---

I develop decision making tools using computational and machine learning techniques
in the domain of production, manufacturing and supply chain.

My focus is on developing scalable production ready tools, using R, Python, VBA etc.,for real-time
material flow optimisations, dynamic scheduling and optimum resource/asset allocations.
Because of the scalable nature of the tools, they can be tailored to the exact
work requirements. Thus, building a set of statistically sound metrics, which aid
management and leadership in prudent decision making.
